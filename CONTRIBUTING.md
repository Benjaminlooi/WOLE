Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! A few quick guidelines to help you get started.

Development Setup
- Node.js LTS recommended. Install dependencies with `npm install` (root). For the web UI: `cd web && npm install`.
- Prebuild native Android once before running: `npx expo prebuild -p android`.
- Run on Android: `npm run android`. Start Metro: `npm run start`. Web UI: `cd web && npm run dev`.

Coding Style
- JavaScript, 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons.
- Naming: camelCase for variables/functions; PascalCase for React components; UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- File names: components `PascalCase.jsx/js`, utilities `camelCase.js`.
- Keep imports ordered: react/expo → third‑party → local.
- Match patterns in `App.js`; avoid adding unused deps.

Scope & Structure
- Root app: `App.js` (UI + relay logic), bootstrap: `index.js`.
- Native glue: `native/WolServerModule.js`.
- Android project in `android/` is generated by Expo prebuild; do not hand‑edit.
- Web UI (Vite + React) in `web/` with `src/` and `vite.config.js`.

Testing
- No harness is configured yet. Recommended:
  - Mobile: Jest + React Native Testing Library.
  - Web: Jest + @testing-library/react with Vite.
- Place tests beside source as `*.test.js` (e.g., `native/wolUtils.test.js`).

Commits & PRs
- Prefer Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(web): serve Vite UI from assets`).
- Keep PRs focused and incremental. Include: description, rationale, test plan, and screenshots for UI changes.
- Link related issues.

Security
- Never commit secrets. The WOL relay expects a shared token in requests; use Tailscale ACLs to restrict access.
- See `SECURITY.md` for reporting guidelines.

Android Notes
- After modifying Android permissions/FGS types, re-run: `npx expo prebuild -p android` then `npm run android`.
- Avoid manual edits in `android/`; prefer Expo config and prebuild.
