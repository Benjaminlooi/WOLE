Security Policy

Supported Versions
- Main branch is supported with security fixes.

Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report security issues privately. Do not open a public issue.
- If the repository is hosted on GitHub, use GitHub Security Advisories to create a private report: navigate to `Security` → `Advisories` → `Report a vulnerability`.
- If Security Advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainer privately (email or other private channel if listed in the project profile).

Scope & Guidance
- Never include sensitive data (tokens, API keys, private IPs) in reports.
- Provide reproduction steps, affected versions/commits, and potential impact.

Best Practices for Users
- Use a strong shared token and restrict access via Tailscale ACLs.
- Keep your device updated and exclude the app from aggressive battery optimizations as needed.
